# Library-Management-System
The Final Project -- C Programming
Library Management System using

Doubly Linked Lists

• Task Description:
Your task for this final project is to create a "Library Management System"
using the C programming language, but this time, you'll be utilizing doubly
linked lists to manage the library's book inventory. The system should enable
you to efficiently add and delete books, as well as view the existing books in
the library.

• Features to Implement:
1. Password Setup: Begin the program by prompting the user to set up a
password. This password will grant access to the library management
operations.
This time, the password is only required at the beginning of the program,
not at each step.
The password should appear as stars or any other symbol.

2. Book Inventory: Use doubly linked lists to store book information,
including:
- Book names
- Author names
- Book ID
- Book prices

3. Add Book: Develop a function that allows users to add books to the
library. Ask the user to enter the book name, author name, unique
book ID, and price. Store this information as a new node in the doubly
linked lists.

4. Delete Book: Implement a function to remove a book from the library
by providing its book ID. If a book with the specified ID exists in the
library, delete its corresponding node from the doubly linked lists.

5. View Books: Create a function to display the list of available books in
the library. This should involve traversing the linked lists and displaying
the book names, author names, book IDs, and prices.
Viewing books is done in a sorted way.
